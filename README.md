# Treatment_and_Transmission
This code accompanies article 'How delayed treatment and non-adherent treatment contribute to onward transmission of malaria: a modelling study', which will be published in BMJ Global Health. 

Here is a description of each file in the project:

* parameters.h (Header file, storing parameters common to the C++ files)
* RK4.cpp (functions for the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models)

* makefile (directive which, for Linux or Mac, compiles and runs C++ model, and [if desired] runs python script which produces a visualisation of the model output)
